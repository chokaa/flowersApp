Flowers application.

Steps to run:

1) npm install

2) npm start

Typescript / React / Redux latest versions are used. Simple frontend website with registration/login/user profile in modal windows using mui material components.
Routing is also there and some user_token which is not handled properly ( Whole thing was done in one day so get creative with it ... ).
